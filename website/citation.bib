  abstract={We present a real-time co-simulation platform integrating power grid operations with urban traffic dynamics for Manhattan. The system combines PyPSA for DC power flow analysis with SUMO for traffic microsimulation, enabling realistic study of grid-vehicle interactions. Key features include Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) emergency restoration where electric vehicles provide power to failed substations, physics-based ASHRAE load modeling with temperature sensitivity, and time-of-day traffic patterns. The platform simulates 8 Manhattan substations with realistic topologies, dynamic vehicle fleets with battery state-of-charge tracking, and EV charging infrastructure with DC fast charging (150 kW) and Level 2 (22 kW) options. We demonstrate emergency scenarios including substation failures, V2G-based restoration, extreme weather impacts on grid loads, and rush hour traffic coordination. The system features real-time visualization, WebSocket-based updates, and an optional AI-enhanced control interface for simplified interaction.},
